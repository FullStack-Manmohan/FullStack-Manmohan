# GitHub profile setup checklist

Use this to finish aligning your GitHub profile with your README. All steps are done on [github.com/FullStack-Manmohan](https://github.com/FullStack-Manmohan) → **Edit profile**.

---

## 1. Bio (copy-paste)

Replace your current bio with this so it matches the README and highlights React/Next.js/Node:

```
Software Engineer @ RCUH (UHERO) · Full-Stack React, Next.js, Node.js · HIPAA-compliant dashboards · Honolulu, HI · Open to work & select projects
```

---

## 2. Profile links

- **Link 1 (Website):** `https://www.manmohanyadav.com`
- **Link 2:** Use for something different — e.g. `https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/manmohanyadav` (Upwork) or `https://www.uptechunt.com` (UpTecHunt), so both slots add value.

---

## 3. Pinned repositories

**Pin 6 repos** that best support “hire me” (full-stack, dashboards, production-style work).  
**How:** Profile → **Customize your pins** → choose 6 repos → add a **short description** and **topics** (e.g. `react`, `nextjs`, `nodejs`, `fullstack`, `dashboard`) for each.

Prioritize repos that show:
- React / Next.js / Node.js
- Dashboards, APIs, or full-stack apps
- Anything related to your featured work (if public)

---

## 4. Optional: Profile README link

This repo’s README is already your profile README. No change needed unless you want to tweak wording or add sections.

---

*Once you’ve done steps 1–3, your profile and README will be fully aligned and hire-ready.*
