### Hi there 👋

I build **secure, production-grade web systems and data dashboards** for research and public health (including Maui Wildfire health impact initiatives)—compliance-driven, privacy-first, role-based access. Outside that, I take on **select full-stack projects**: modern web apps, dashboards, portals, and automations end-to-end.

**What I build (most requested):**
- Performance, stability, and "messy system" cleanup
- API integrations, data pipelines, and automated reporting
- Dashboards & admin panels (secure access + audit-friendly workflows)
- Full-stack web apps (React, Next.js, Node.js)

If you need a **senior, hands-on engineer** who can own delivery (architecture → build → launch → iterate), reach out with your goal, timeline, and stack.
